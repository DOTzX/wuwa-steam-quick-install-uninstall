# Pre-Download WUWA on Steam using Launcher

## Requirement
- Official Launcher ready to start the game and has finished updating
- Official Launcher and Steam version must be on an NTFS file system (can be on a different drive)
- Administrative privileges are required because the script uses symlinks

## Procedure for upcoming pre-downloads:
1. (When the pre-download period begins)
2. Pre-download the game through the launcher
3. (When maintenance begins)
4. Apply updates through the launcher
5. Perform a **SAFE UNINSTALL** of Wuthering Waves on Steam following this guide
6. Perform a **QUICK INSTALLATION** of Wuthering Waves on Steam following this guide

## Important notes after following this guide:
- Pre-downloads must be done through the official launcher. This guide only facilitates the process on Steam.
- Automatic updates on Steam must be set to “Wait until I launch the game”, it prevents Steam from patching the official launcher files when a major update arrives.
- A safe uninstall is **MANDATORY** for each major version update.
